#include "Circle.h"

/*ostream &operator<<(ostream& out, Circle right)
{
	string temp;
	temp = right.shapeArea + " | " + right.shapeArea;
	out << temp;
	return out;
}*/

// basically, the operator im trying to overload needs to be outside of the class that im working with, and it needs to overload the o or ofstream not the circle.
// additionally, it's passed 2 parameters: a stream, and an object. see page 759 for details.
